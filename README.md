# Project Title:
## English–Spanish Translation Website Using Google Translate API

Project Overview
This project is a lightweight web application that translates English text into Spanish using the Google Translate API. The platform was built using basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and is designed to offer users a quick and easy way to get real-time Spanish translations for English input.

Purpose and Core Features
Accepts user input in English.
When the user clicks “Translate”, the app sends a request to the Google Translate API.
The translated Spanish result is displayed instantly below.
Designed to be responsive across phones, tablets, and desktops.

Languages Used in Translation
Source Language: English
Target Language: Spanish
This bilingual setup was chosen for its practicality, especially for users who interact with Spanish speakers, study Spanish, or work in bilingual environments.

API Used
API Name: Google Translate API
Organization: Google Cloud
Commentary:
Google Cloud’s Translate API was straightforward to set up. The documentation helped me activate the service from the Google Cloud Console, generate an API key, and understand the required URL structure for making translation requests. The response format (JSON) was simple to work with in JavaScript, and I was able to build the functionality without needing external libraries or frameworks. The whole process was beginner-friendly and clearly explained.
